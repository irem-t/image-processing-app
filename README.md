# Image Processing with PySide6 and OpenCV

## Description
This project is a GUI application for image processing using PySide6 and OpenCV. It allows users to apply filters, detect edges, perform blurring, and visualize transformations like the magnitude spectrum of images.

## Features
- **Load Images:** Select an image file to load into the application.
- **Apply Filters:**
  - Threshold filters (adjustable via sliders).
  - Gaussian blur with customizable kernel size.
- **Edge Detection:** Use the Canny edge detection algorithm.
- **Circle Detection:** Detect circles in grayscale images (e.g., X-ray or MRI images).
- **Precise Edge Detection:** Visualize precise edges using the Scharr operator.
- **Magnitude Spectrum:** Display and save the magnitude spectrum of an image.

## Installation
1. Install Python 3.9 or later.
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/irem-t/image-processing-app.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd image-processing-app
   ```
4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
2. Use the GUI to load an image and apply desired operations.

## Dependencies
- PySide6
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
